# Education-data-analysis-in-developing-countries
I use R to analyze education data from DHS and MICS surveys in West Africa. My goal is to find where and why children (ages 3–14) are starting school late and how it impacts learning outcomes and long-run enrollment rate. I use my experience from the World Bank and my studies at TSE to turn raw data into clear maps and charts that help people make better decisions for schools.
